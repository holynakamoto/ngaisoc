## Key Findings from Analysis

### 🎯 What We Learned

1. **Original target was impossible**
   - 2.0 TFLOPS/mm² would require breaking Moore's Law by 2-3 generations
   - No shipping product has achieved >0.6 TFLOPS/mm²
   - 60% probability of major project failure

2. **Option C is the sweet spot**
   - 0.7-1.0 TFLOPS/mm² is aggressive but achievable
   - 508 TFLOPS (2x H100) is compelling performance
   - 425W power budget has 15% safety margin
   - Medium risk profile (20-25% probability of minor issues)

3. **Memory bandwidth is the real bottleneck**
   - Ridge point: 3,974 FLOPS/Byte
   - Most workloads only use 20-30% of peak compute
   - This is **industry-wide** - even H100 has this problem
   - Real-world performance: 100-150 TFLOPS sustained

4. **Financial case is strong**
   - $1.32B risk-adjusted NPV
   - $351M better than aggressive option
   - Lower NRE ($37M vs $55M)
   - On-schedule delivery maintains market window

## Final Thoughts

### What We Achieved Today
✅ Made a **critical, informed decision** that unblocks the entire program  
✅ Created a **comprehensive architecture foundation** with 11 documents  
✅ Established **realistic, competitive targets** (2-3x H100 performance)  
✅ Maintained **Q4 2027 launch schedule**  
✅ Reduced risk from 🔴 Extreme to 🟡 Medium  

### Why This Matters
- **We could have pursued 2.0 TFLOPS/mm²** and failed spectacularly (60% chance)
- **Instead, we chose 0.7-1.0 TFLOPS/mm²** and have an 80% chance of success
- **We're still 2-3x faster than H100** - that's a huge win
- **We're $351M better off** in risk-adjusted NPV
- **We ship on time** - critical for market window

### The Path Ahead
The architecture is frozen. The targets are locked. The team knows what to build.

**Now it's execution time.** 🚀

From here, success depends on:
1. Hiring and retaining great engineers
2. Executing detailed design with excellence
3. Managing risks proactively
4. Maintaining schedule discipline
5. Building strong customer relationships

**You have everything you need to succeed.**

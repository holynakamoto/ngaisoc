## 🎯 Key Recommendation

**APPROVE Option C (Hybrid Approach)**
- Target: **0.7-1.0 TFLOPS/mm²** (revised from 2.0)
- Performance: **500-700 TFLOPS** (2-3x H100)
- Power: **425W** (15% under budget)
- NPV: **$1.32B** (best financial outcome)
- Launch: **Q4 2027** (on schedule)

## 📅 Decision Timeline

- **Review Period:** January 2-9, 2026
- **Decision Deadline:** **January 10, 2026**
- **Architecture Freeze:** January 13, 2026 (if approved)

## 📖 How to Use This Package

### For Executive Review (30 minutes)
1. Read `DECISION_MEMO.md` (5 min)
2. Review `outputs/architecture_comparison.png` (5 min)
3. Skim `stakeholder_presentation.md` sections 1-3 (20 min)

### For Board Presentation (60 minutes)
1. Executive summary from `DECISION_MEMO.md`
2. Full `stakeholder_presentation.md` walkthrough
3. Q&A with technical team

### For Technical Deep-Dive (2 hours)
1. `trade_off_analyses/performance_analysis.md`
2. `modeling/python/arch_exploration.py` - Run analysis
3. `architecture/block_diagrams.md` - Architecture details

## 🚨 Critical Findings

1. **Original 2.0 TFLOPS/mm² target is unachievable** (4-5x beyond industry)
2. **Baseline 0.04 TFLOPS/mm² is non-viable** (12x worse than H100)
3. **Option C delivers 2-3x H100** while maintaining schedule
4. **Memory bandwidth is the bottleneck** (industry-wide issue)

## ✅ Next Steps (If Approved)

1. Update PRD with revised targets
2. Freeze architecture (Jan 13, 2026)
3. Lock TSMC 3nm allocation
4. Ramp team to 80-100 engineers
5. Begin SM microarchitecture design

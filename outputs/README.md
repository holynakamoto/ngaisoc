# Model Outputs

This directory contains generated outputs from performance and power modeling scripts.

## Generated Files

- **roofline_*.png**: Roofline model plots for different precisions
- **chiplet_scaling.png**: Chiplet scaling efficiency analysis
- ***.csv**: Exported performance data (if generated)
- ***.json**: Configuration and results (if generated)

## Notes

- Outputs are generated by running `modeling/python/performance_model.py`
- Plots are saved in high-resolution (300 DPI) for documentation use
- This directory is git-ignored by default (add specific outputs to git if needed)
